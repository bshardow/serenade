Hi!

I'm Bashiru, a Product Manager by day and a Cultural Commentator by birth.

I've built this website as a pool for my musings, some new, some old but all with the same goal in mind; to share a piece of my personality with the world. 

I write about Travel, Identity, Work and everything in between.

Welcome to my world.
