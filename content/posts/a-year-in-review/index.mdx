Haruki Murakami is just that guy. 

That’s it, that’s the review. 

A quick and measured take on a man who in my eyes, can do no wrong. 

For many, it’s the expertly precise plots he carefully weaves across his revered and varied novels, Norwegian Wood and Men without Women to name a few. 

I can’t really relate to them though. If I’m being honest, I haven’t even read those two books. I mean if I managed to reference books I’d never read in my dissertation, I’m most certainly going to do it here.

But I digress, I will read those books at some point, especially after my introduction to a man who I’d now go as far as calling an inspiration of mine. 

The introduction I talk of? 

“What I talk about when I talk about running”, Murakami’s autobiography and philosophical mantra. 

Brief yet comprehensive, Murakami talks to a goal of completing the 2005 NY Marathon and everything prior that led him to this moment. 

He talks of his time running a jazz bar in Tokyo, before stumbling upon his savant like gift of novel writing. 

He talks of becoming a full time writer, and leaving Tokyo for a smaller more quaint prefecture to suit the solitude of his new profession. 

He talks of the balance required to facilitate his career as a writer, brought on by his habit (read: addiction) of a daily run, cultivating the desire to compete in not only marathons, but triathlons and ultimately, ultramarathons. 

Murakami details the enriching moments that came with both of his crafts, from writing and running on the black sand beaches of Hawaii, to completing the original marathon route in 50 degree heat in Athens. Crazy shit.

You think I even knew what an Ultramarathon was?! Murakami the visionary, David Goggins could never!

The point I make with that shabby recap, is not to replay his running and writing exploits, but to amplify the fluidity of this amazing human. Murakami lives like he’s playdough, to the energised toddler that is life, throwing him in every direction as he just rolls with it.

He’s like a cat in reverse, living his nine lives through one. 

I read this book in between the frequent cab trips I took around Accra back in 2018, often left in deep thought, and inspiration as I read, re-read before finally completing it.  

I picked the book back up in the 60th month of 2020. Its brilliance remained intact, but I came away with an added reverence of the practicality of it. 

There’s a beauty in connecting the dots to an autobiography and in doing so applying it to your own life.

Now I’m not saying I can run or write like Murakami, but I can attest to the importance of consistency and how that quality shines brighter than anything else in our skillset, or how an over-reliance on God given talent won’t yield a single thing without the groundwork.

Given the earlier exploits highlighted, I doubt it will come as a surprise to anyone that Murakami writes and runs every day. 

2020 saw me break out of my comfort zone, and for large parts of the year follow a similar pattern of frequent and consistent running. Starting with 5k runs 3-4 times a week, before incorporating a longer 10k run in on the weekends.

Murakami runs to the beat of his own heart, and for that matter his brain as he used his runs as a time to memorise speeches. Whilst I used the time to listen to something deep, be it a podcast or an audiobook. The goal of which was to make running the secondary activity to my thoughts, where I sought to draw parallels between real life and whatever I was listening to, whilst getting a sense of accomplishment through being active.

Murakami never painted his challenge as a race to being his fastest, but a race for sufficiency, and in that a race to being optimal. Being in optimal shape to run every day by not running his farthest or fastest. Writing enough every day, not going outside of himself to avoid a lull in his writing the following day. 

This year, I’ve just ran and it’s like my tank has never been on empty. Rising at the cracking of dawn, having a glass of water before stepping out the door, pushing start on my Strava app, before letting my legs do the work. The trial of a choice, became a habit and in turn, a structure formed with the singular goal of finding balance. 

Run after run, self-negotiation became self-improvement, positively correlating with my growth in self-awareness.

The irony and cliché of the above, is that this year hasn’t brought me any closer to that understanding of self, but has at the very least put me on the right path of exploring what and how I will begin to spread my wings in this life.

One of the key takeaways from Murakami’s book isn’t to ignite the inner runner or novelist in all of us, but to take an almost reverse look at the fruits of his labour. Outside of his awe inspiring feats, perhaps the hardest thing to connect with is the difficulty and expertise involved in being so consistent. 

As I see it, Murakami is consistent because he has a degree of balance, that in turn is reflected in his running and writing, the past times that are suitable for his life. It’s not to suggest everything he writes is golden, and every run is a world beater, but it’s the hard work that makes things easier. I mean what’s better five  consistent ‘7 out of 10s’  or one inconsistent ’10 out of 10’?!

I can relate on all levels. 

2020 has been the year I’ve cemented my balance. A combination of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, Running, a predominantly plant based diet (read: Flexitarian or Flégan), and more recently, calisthenic workouts have shifted my mind. 

They’ve shifted my weight too, seeing me drop over 15 kilograms since lockdown started back in March. Some feat in itself, but just one aspect of a healthier mindset and lifestyle I’ve adopted. I’m determined to take things up a gear, oddly enough trying my hand at Murakami’s bread and butter; writing. 

There is no end goal with this, I write when inspired, I write when I feel, I write to get a bit of my personality across and I write to feel balance. 

Who knows where it will take me?

The most poignant part of Murakami’s book is him envisaging his tombstone…

The way the world sees us irrelevant to the way we see ourselves. 

Murakami has shown me that focusing on the latter, will inform the premier. 

Onwards and upwards for 2021.
