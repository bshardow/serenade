I can be a prick. 


Argumentative, a bit condescending, and still probably harbouring an unresolved issue with authority that predates secondary school.

I like to talk though, to anyone and everyone for that matter. If I were a cat, then curiosity has yet to catch me, and I’m very much still living my first life.

Travel hasn’t just opened the door to new locations for me, but it has unearthed a desire to attempt to scratch below the surface wherever I go. 

It’s a flawed mantra. I’m aware that self-perception differs from how the world views me, and with that impacts any interaction I have. For better or for worse I don’t know, but golden moments still prevail.

I met Adnan for the first time on my second day in Istanbul, as I sought out some decent food in my new neighbourhood of Beyoglu. I stumbled upon his quaint falafel shop and thought why not. Being a picky eater and a vocal one at that, I was impressed by his customer service and his willingness to customise almost everything on the menu to meet my wants. A pleasant but short interaction, I had got my timings wrong and had to rush back to my apartment for a meeting. 

We spoke properly on our second encounter a week later. 


We went from first names, to an instant chemistry and familiarity that could only be brought on by the most common universal language known to man; football.

Liverpool’s rise to the top had rattled both of us, but we admired from afar. Me, with a Liverpool-crazy father and Adnan; because he didn’t like their style of football. I mean the gegenpress can’t last forever, can it?!

We both understood what it meant to be an expat, in our own ways. Adnan, first-hand as a man who had left Damascus for Istanbul back in 2014. Then I, primarily as the son of one, but also a Londoner wandering through Istanbul as a Digital Nomad taking full advantage of my company’s newfound Work From Anywhere policy.

He was intrigued by where I came from, yet got the sentiment completely when I told him I was from London. It was the African flags I wore proudly on my bracelet that piqued his interest. 

Ghana & Nigeria I told him, before offering it to him. He giggled nervously, and refused before eventually giving into my persistence. His kids would love it, he told me. 


We spoke about my job; something I don’t like doing, and we spoke about how his time in the city had come to be. Adnan and his family had forged lives for themselves in both Turkey and Germany. He could not hide his pride as he reminisced about a childhood filled with love and laughter in his homeland, and similarly, could not hide his disappointment as he lamented the corruption and destruction of the country’s regime.

I could sense his toughness, and his desire to seek the truth. He spoke to that, and told me about how he’d sought it out from all avenues possible. In the end, he’d found that whilst every source was valid in their own right, all roads led back to his religion of choice; Islam.

We shared a disdain and distrust for western powers’, and he expressed a gratitude for what his residence in Turkey had facilitated for him; a wife, two kids, his very own falafel shop and the opportunity to de-stress through a weekly game of football, he so passionately described.

It was only natural that he extended an invite for a game of 8 aside with a group of expats. I accepted and it was settled; I’d meet him outside the shop a week from now at 7.15pm. 


The proximity of his shop to my flat, meant that I bumped into him near enough everyday before then. Always busy, but always smiling we’d rush to greet each other, Adnan re-confirming my place and the details for the game, and me telling him I’d definitely be there.

Had I known he lived an hour away from the pitch, I’d have made my own way. But, Adnan saw it fit he took me there. We took the subway from Sishane to Osmanbey and walked over to Ferikoy, a more working class area, neighbouring the more bougie area of Nisantasi. We reached the stadium, and it looked no different from my games at home; Syrians, Danes, Ghanaians, Iraqis, Belgians and of course, Turks coming together for some Tuesday evening fun.

As I watched Adnan bring the football down with his shoulder, I knew I wasn’t here for a kickabout. I was shocked, these guys were here for war and there was me in my Adidas Ultraboost trying my best not to fall over.

Not a game for the neutral. Flying tackles, misplaced passes, diving, a few moments of individual and a multilingual barrage of shouting saw us through the match as victors. 

After the game, we spoke, laughed and exchanged small talk as a group. We went our separate ways and I walked back alone to the metro station; exhilarated by both the game and the experience.

One of my favourite travel experiences to date.


Thank you Adnan for showing me a bit of your world, and allowing me to scratch below the surface.
