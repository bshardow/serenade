“Everybody hates labels, but they sure love identities” 


An old of tweet of mine, that I definitely stole from somewhere and sounded a lot funnier in my head .

I mean I think it’s true though, the idea of being labelled something on social media tends to evoke negative sentiments. It’s often done to you as opposed to being done by you. To identify with something, well that’s where the power lies. It’s an autonomous move that empowers as opposed to discredits.

Our identity is what we are, and there is no single word to define a human’s existence.


Take me for example. I’m Black, I’m a man, I’m heterosexual, I’m working class, I’m British, from Ghana, from Nigeria, from London, from Ladbroke Grove,.. I’m me? All facts that can’t be refuted, but again don’t really mean anything until you (eye) look at them in relation to my lived experiences. 

It’s as if our identities are the solution to a complex equation, where the values are constantly changing. Our identities are the answer, yet there always subject to change. Guided by a rigid set of principles brought on by a perceived sense of self. In my eyes, a bit of a contradiction.

One that I’ve had to confront first hand through my experiences on the road. I don’t think I could live without travelling, outside of the pure enjoyment it brings it’s been my vehicle to self-discovery. A time where I’m able to go outside of myself; in activity, in conversation and in thought. 

A moment that always stuck with me was a passing conversation in a hostel in Hoi An, Vietnam. I was sat amongst a group of solo travellers, like myself and one of them used the term backpackers to describe us, a label which I thought would never apply to me. I liked the hostel experience, and constantly being on the move but, I was no backpacker, just someone who’d been and was backpacking. 

To be labelled a backpacker was both bemusing and surprising. I knew backpackers; they were Aussies and Kiwis venturing across Asia and the rest of the world, in search of a new experience, middle class kids taking a gap year to travel the world on a line of credit, that stretched all the way back to their parents’ lawns or post-university adults looking to travel before beginning the rest of their lives. Backpackers were a fairly wide pool of people, but for me, they just weren’t black.

In my head, I had surmised my travels as a fly on the wall experience that allowed me to peer into the mindsets and perspective of others whilst completely being assured in mine. I could relate to the people I’d met on the road, but never thought they could relate to me.

Yes I was western, Yes I was university educated and Yes I was doing a graduate scheme at a Bank, but outside of those facts, I couldn’t see any parallels that would put me in such groupings. 


The interaction got me thinking. Even if I wasn’t a ‘backpacker’, what was it about me that made the group comfortable in including me? And equally what was it in me that allowed me to put myself out there and attempt to navigate the world as freely as possible?

I thought about the three weeks I spent in Salvador. A place I eagerly anticipated visiting from even before I decided to spend 4 months travelling around South America. In a continent that had undertaken a sustained effort to whitewash its population, 90% Black Salvador felt like the perfect place to soak in some culture and lock in with the Brazilian section of the global diaspora.

What struck me most about Salvador, was that poverty worked hand in hand with racism leaving Afro-Brazilians at the bottom of a society where they were the majority. Whilst I loved the cultural richness of the city, it’s people and the vitality I got in seeing people who look like me every day. I couldn’t escape the fundamental differences between me, in Salvador on an extended vacation and the local population.

The realisation of this came when I took a trip with my hostel to the local beach, and found myself as one of few black people there, who wasn’t working.  I remember being uncomfortable about this, but on closer inspection, I remember subduing a greater emotion of guilt, at the privilege that life had afforded me. In the face of people who looked just like me.


Even then, I felt seen on so many levels out there, and with that I felt a degree of vulnerability. The locals saw me as a fellow black man, but also saw the class and foreign privilege that I came with. It fostered authentic conversation regarding my blackness, where I was from and what that meant to me. It also meant people could lean on me, recognising our similarities but the difference in our lived experiences.

I just don’t think we can ignore them or paint a picture of self or group without considering them. 


Our lived experiences inform how we move in this world.  A chance encounter  with  two Ghanaians on a football pitch in Istanbul exemplified this. With all of us hailing from Accra, an instant bond was formed. That didn’t change when I told them I was born and bred in London, but things did get realer. They spoke of the trials and tribulations of being Black expats in a country that would only ever look at them at best like, immigrants and at worst, as sub human. I felt that, but the irony was not lost on me that I had been invited on a whim, by the Syrian man who owned a falafel shop by my apartment to play with his diverse group of friends. Whilst, the two Ghanaian guys, Augustine and Francis were only there because the group needed goalkeepers.

It would be foolish to look past skin colour, our shared heritage and to some extent, culture as something to bound us together, but outside of that our link was at best tenuous when you considered how divergent our experiences had been. Even to the point where we were all doing the same thing (playing football), yet clearly having different perceptions of it. 


The same can be said with people who I’d presume would have similar life experiences to me. As I strolled around Harlem with an African American friend I was reminded that there was no single definition of ‘blackness’ for some. I had told him that the area was home to all kinds of black people, to which he responded that it was only African Americans who were black, and not people who originated from Africa or the Caribbean. The irony.

I didn’t agree but with time, I understood his reasoning.  There is no singular black experience to inform the way that black people see and navigate the world – if we’re being brutally honest our identities and the way we experience things are just ours. 

Some things are undeniable though. Wherever we’re the minority, I’m sure we can all attest to the subconscious yet instant reaction we get that undresses us and strips us down to what appears to be the only thing non-black people can see… our skin. I’ve had the uncomfortable human zoo like experience in Beijing and the ice cold stares in places where we make up little to none of the population. 

It’s that ‘othering’ feeling that has motivated me in reaching out to Black people anywhere and everywhere where we’re in the minority. It doesn’t kill me, but at the same time I recognise the power in being made to feel welcome. From corporate settings in London, to quaint beaches in the Philippines, if I see a fellow black person I’m letting it be known. I’m trying to talk and by doing so, trying to get a sense of how they feel in navigating relatively foreign environments.

It’s even an assumption that they see these places as foreign, and with that no interaction is ever the same, and so it should be.


We’re individuals at the end of the day, and our feelings are our own. I subscribe to the idea of being part of a global community of blackness. Not concerned about class, religion, gender, sexuality or any other aspects of identity. 

I recognise and respect all of those things though and appreciate how they change our world perception. 


I’ve come to the realisation that to truly be part this community is to champion our differences and take time with our own, irrespective on how their views might diverge from ours.


Before I can even speak for anyone else, I affirm that the best role I can play is being myself. 

A backpacker.
