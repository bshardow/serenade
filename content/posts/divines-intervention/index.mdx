Modes of transport and Accra just don’t go. 

There’s one.. the road, and in that there’s a number of actors.

The advent of ride-sharing apps has all but created a new lane for locals and diasporans alike that have seen many transition away from the famed yet rarely revered two toned taxi cabs that are as synonymous with the country as the kente cloth. 

I swore by cabs, and in that suffered the almost daily battle of hailing one successfully.

My latest trip to Accra has been a Bolt bonanza. 

Feeling for an americano? Get a Bolt, going there and back still worked out cheaper than a coffee back home.

Feeling to shake a leg? Get a Bolt, even cheaper at night and the early hours of the morning.

Feeling to get out the city?  Try and get a Bolt, try and get an Uber, try and get a Taxi.. hell even try and get an Okada. Just try and get someone to take you!

The age-old issue, getting someone to wilfully take you outside the city. For one reason or the other, drivers have and continue to be abrasive at the idea of doing so.

I get it, I’m empathetic to it, but then I’m not. Drivers put their mathematician caps on, solving hypothetical equations at the cost effectiveness of taking you on said trip. I mean it does make sense, I just wish they done this before I got in the car!

If I had a cedi for every time I heard the phrase..

“Hello sir, please where are we going today?”

I’d be a very rich man.

But instead I was just a very delayed man and that really wasn’t the plan for my weekend after a long week of work. 

“Shai Hills, Aburi or Gomoa Fetteh?” I shouted at my cousin as he chilled on the veranda, suddenly overcome with energy even though I’d barely slept.

“Gomoa Fetteh”, my cousin Martin replied in his assured and stoic manner. I’m not even sure he knew where it was but I was too impressed to question by his authorative response.

“How we getting there though bro?” he asked half knowing the answer. 

“Cab… but let’s cross that bridge when it comes”, I responded having already envisioned the negative eventuality we’d soon be faced with.

But it was settled, and by hook or crook we were off to Gomoa Fetteh. A dreamy and quaint beach town in the central region of the country, roughly two hours outside the capital.  

It wasn’t exactly close, but with large parts of the population at church we were guaranteed minimal to no traffic. By Ghana standards, the trip wasn’t cheap either, amounting to 120 cedis (£15) to get there and likely the same to get back.

Price wasn’t dominating our thoughts though, it was hailing a cab to get us there.

My two cousins and I excited at the prospect of  this new environment got ready in rapid fashion. Ready by 9:30am… yet couldn’t find a cab by 10:30am

Nonsense. Expected nonsense.

We experienced it all. Drivers who would accept the trip and literally remain stationary on the map until you cancelled.

The drivers who would insist on messaging you through the app to find out your destination, and then cancelling upon finding out where.

The more creative drivers who would extract my British number saved to the app, save it to their phone only to WhatsApp call me and then cancel after realising where I was going. 

Even with us putting our three heads, three phones and six apps together, we were all but resigned to defeat. 

It took Divine’s Intervention to finally get us on the road.

No not God, well maybe God but Divine’s intervention.
“Your driver Divine W is arriving in 2 mins (XWY76), please wear your mask and abide by COVID-19 protocols”, lit up on my cousin Ashley’s screen and caught all of our attention as we waited impatiently. 

More of the same we thought as we watched his movements on the map, half expecting him to stop where he was or call Ashley and ask where we we’re going.

Looking back, he was probably shocked by our shock at him actually arriving. 

We jumped in as soon as he did, avoiding eye contact, wearing our nose masks and asking absolutely no questions.

 “Where to?” Divine asked in a calm yet reassuring manner. 

Looking at Ashley, we both knew the jig was up.

“Gomoa Fetteh” I said begrudgingly. 

Divine chucked to himself, sensing my angst at his question…

“Bro I no get stress… let’s go” he replied as he put his foot down. 

I laughed, laughed more and then told my cousins that this was my guy. Divine W. What a name.

We all laughed, we all spoke, listened to tunes as we got acquainted over that two hour trip. 

15 minutes in and I knew this wouldn’t be the last time our paths would cross. Partially because I was going to ask him to take us back, but equally because I thought it would be dope if he’d join us on our day trip.

He jumped at the chance and got even more comfortable as the journey went on. 

The conversation went everywhere, we spoke about the places we drove by, me remarking on the greenery and calmness I was feeling in being outside of the city. 

While Divine provided technical analysis on the vegetative nature of the land, and the agricultural activities that were likely taking place as we ventured up the Volta. 

We got lost on the way, but still in good spirits we persevered through, going from being in the middle of literally nowhere on a dirt road path to nearing on paradise.  

As we neared we all grew in excitement. The place was beautiful there were no clouds in the sky, and virtually nobody in sight outside of a few local children digging sand which would then be sold to a quarry (Divine’s expert analysis not mine). After foiling the gateman’s plans to take 20 cedis from us entering a beach front resort we made our way down to the beach to sit and relax.

We got there and laughed in surprise. We were at one the nicest beaches any of us had seen in Ghana, and yet, we were the only black people there. Gomoa Fetteh seemed like a haven for migrants, especially French ones. 

Who cared though?! After all, we were there for a good time and not a long time. Bemused by our setting,  we sat down, ordered some drinks and food as continued to laugh and joke like old friends.

We actually did bump into an old friend – well Divine did anyway. Albert walked past us and as their eyes met there was an instant magnetism that quickly fused and broke out into a rapturous display of pidgin as they greeted each other after what had clearly been a long time!

They’d gone to Accra Academy together many moons ago – one of the oldest and most prestigious schools in the country. After school they’d drifted but you could tell they had a strong bond. Albert was Japanese-Ghanaian and eerily wore both ethnicities in perfect unison. But even then, he was probably the most Ghanaian guy I’d met out there. He was a cool cat and that showed in the way he carried himself. Something like Bené from City of God, with a beautiful girl on his arm and abundance of ‘wiii’  for his laidback Sunday. 

The day progressed with us veering too and from the sea front, running around before all doing our own thing for a bit. There’s just something about beaches that call out all of our inner introverts.

I went to the bar for a malt and Divine was sitting down having a drink too. He told me a bit about himself, and his plans for the future. He’d recently completed a Masters in Fishery Science and was considering the option of a PHD abroad but in the meantime was focused on creating opportunities for himself and others through his own ventures in the city. 

Unfocused by the naysayers, he was determined to make something of himself and in that, something that could be scaled in his beloved nation.

“Bash, I’m worth more than working 9-5 for 30 years, I’m worth more than getting rich, my worth resides in the long lasting opportunities I can create for myself and others in this country”, he said in a measured and confident voice. 

Divine was adventurous, ambitious, bold and comfortable all at the very same time.

It’s rare to find a jack of all trades, master of one and all round ‘people person’.

Divine was that and then some, a guy who we’d just about met and in the space of hours had been seen a welcomed member of what had been a family trip to the seaside. 

An age mate, with a sense of self and the many ways he could be fluid enough to stretch his wings for the betterment of all. 

An inspiration.

By happenstance.

Divine’s Intervention.
